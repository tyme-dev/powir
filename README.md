## About The Project

### What is it?

Powir is a Windows 10 based tool to monitor and analyze your system's power and battery usage.

It provides you with various information and statistics about the current and overall history of the power and battery usage of your system.

### Installation

There are two ways to install powir:

- [Desktop App (Main Mode)](#desktop-app-main-mode): Installation is as quick as simply downloading the executable and running it.
The App is completely portable meaning you don't have to go through an installation wizard, 
and it can be copied from system to system seamlessly without any dependencies or extra files needed. **Recommended**
  - Terminal: Simply download the binary and run it:
  ```bash
  curl -L https://github.com/SlapBot/powir/releases/download/v1.0.4/powir.1.0.4.exe --output powir.exe
  ./powir
  ```
  - Double Click: Again [download](#desktop-app-main-mode) the binary and run it but please read this [note](#browser-and-windows-defender-warnings)

- [Browser Window (Lite Mode)](#browser-window-lite-mode): Installation requires few pre-requisites (node & npm) and firing a command from the command prompt which opens up a tab in your default browser serving file via a local server. Actions (Export PDF, JSON) are missing in the lite mode.

## Features
![](demos/processed-screenshots/about.png)

### What it does?
- Provides you with a simple and clean UI to list your battery and system information.
- Shows you the change in battery capacity since the OS was installed.
- Analyzes the current and overall estimated battery life of your system.
- Computes various statistics to give a better understanding of your power usage.
- Ability to export all the data via various formats: PDF (app), JSON (processed), HTML (original report).
- 100% free and completely open-source for an absolute transparency.
- Completely portable app with no installation required, ready to use out of the box.


### Why build it?
- Complete lack of any such power/battery monitoring analyzing tool available in the market.
- Obscure documentation over how to find battery statuses on the Internet.
- Required to use terminal in order to run a command showing information about the system.
- Devoid of any simple and understandable metrics from the underlying API or report.


### Actions

![](demos/processed-screenshots/actions.png)

- Export the current report of your system from Powir in PDF format
- Export the parsed and processed data of your system from Powir in JSON format
- Shows original report generated by Windows using the command: `powercfg /batteryreport` in the terminal

#### Only one time setup

Commands (copy-paste):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SlapBot/powir.git
cd powir
npm install --production
```

Explanation:
- Ensure you have git, node and npm installed using commands: `git --version`, `node -v` and `npm -v` respectively, else install it from here: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (installer contains both node and npm)
- Clone the repository using: `git clone https://github.com/SlapBot/powir.git` and cd into the folder: `cd powir`
- Run `npm install --production` to install dependencies

#### Anytime

Command (copy-paste)
```bash
npm run lite-mode
```

Explanation:
- Now simply run `npm run lite-mode` whenever you want from the directory, and it will open up the dashboard allowing you to monitor and analyze power states.

## FAQs

![](demos/processed-screenshots/FAQs.png)

<strong>Is it completely free?</strong>

Yes, Powir is 100% free to download and use.

<strong>Are the numbers displayed 100% correct?</strong>

Depends, Powir parses the raw reports generated from Windows and does the computations of the various statistics and render the charts.

<strong>What tooling is used to build the app?</strong>

Powir runs as an electron app (chromium web engine embedded) while using React to facilitate the UI and data workflow.

<strong>Does it share my data anywhere?</strong>

No, Powir will never share your data anywhere outside your local system, the entire source code of the app is online for anyone to check. In fact, it never makes any request to a server since there is none. Its simply a client sided app.
